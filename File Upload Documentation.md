## File Upload

### Uploading a File

- **Endpoint**: `https://api.example.com/upload`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**: 
  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
- **Body**: Include the file in the request as form-data.

### Steps

1. Obtain an access token from the OAuth endpoint.
2. Prepare the file for upload according to the API's specifications.
3. Construct a POST request to the file upload endpoint with the appropriate headers and file data.
4. Process the API's response to determine the success or failure of the upload.

### Example cURL Command

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/upload   -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"   -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"   -F "file=@path_to_your_file"
```

## Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: Your access token is invalid or expired.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request is improperly formatted.
- **413 Payload Too Large**: The file size exceeds the allowed limit.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

## Security Notes

- Securely store your access tokens and credentials.
- Communicate over HTTPS to protect the data in transit.
