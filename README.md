# Overview 
Welcome to the Historic England API project (H.API)

Historic Environment Records (sometimes referred to as Sites and Monuments Records) may be held by County Councils, District Councils or Unitary Authorities. In each case, the record will cover the whole of the local authority area. Selected major historic towns and cities are covered by Urban Archaeological Databases (UADs). In many cases, UADs are held as part of, and are accessible via, the local Historic Environment Record.
